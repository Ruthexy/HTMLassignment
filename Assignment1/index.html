    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p><h4>My Journey: An autobiography by Ruth Okwuokenye</h4> </p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">My name is Ruth Okwuokenye, I was born on December 21,2000,in Lagos NIGERIA. Growing up in a close-knit christian family, I was surrounded by love,support and a strong work ethic that shaped who I am today.My parents, (my mum an educator and my dad a transporter), instilled in me the value of lifelong learning and the importance of giving back to others. I have two siblings, (an older sister and a younger brother).
        As a child, I was curious about everything. I always asked questions and was not afraid to voice out my opinions on things that I found fascinating and I was always ready to solve problems . That passion for problem-solving grew stronger during my school years, where I excelled in science. In high school, I was always first in most things and I had a passion for creating things and that led me on to pursue my career in science. I graduated from high school in 2016 and took my senior school leaving certificate examination in 2017. 
        In 2019 I enrolled at the University of Benin, Benin City Nigeria  to study Chemistry . University was both challenging and rewarding. While balancing rigorous coursework, I was also the class rep for my level and went on to being the department president. I had little breaks here and there where I got occupied with teaching because I loved little children. I graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in science.
        Although I loved my career, I felt the need to create a larger impact and that was why I decided to take up a course in tech. After learning a bit about the different careers in tech I decided that frontend engineering was the perfect choice for me. I enrolled for a course with the Alt school school of engineering initiative and I am currently studying that.
        Outside of work, I love cooking different meals as that is a way for me to decompress and I have learnt a lot and can actually call myself a professional. I also love going out and trying new places and new meals but that is not something I do often since I don't have the finances for it now.
        Looking back, my journey has been one of curiosity, hard work, and growth. I’m proud of the person I’ve become and excited about what the future holds. Whether it’s through mentoring, tech, cooking for my loved ones or simply being a good friend, I hope to continue making a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
        <h2>WHY I JOINED THE PROGRAM</h2>
        <p id="second-paragraph">From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it offers, but I’ve faced my fair share of challenges in pursuing this passion.
            I’ve been on a learning path, navigating free courses, tutorials and online resources in order to sharpen my tech skills. I’ve learned a lot through self-study but I cannot go too far on my own. I needed a structured, in-depth training to truly grow and develop the skills required to succeed in the tech industry and Alt school could be the game changer I have been hoping for.
            
            I am not just pursuing tech education for myself. I believe technology has the power to change lives and solve problems. My dream is to one day develop solutions that address real world challenges like improving access to education, healthcare or economic opportunities.
            
            I’m particularly interested in frontend development, which is integral to creating user-friendly solutions. AltSchool’s practical, hands-on approach will help me understand not just the theory behind these disciplines but how to apply them in the real world. With experienced instructors and access to industry-standard tools, I can refine my skills and become a well-rounded tech professional.
            I wanted to not only improve my own life but also contribute to the greater tech ecosystem. I was eager to learn, grow and most importantly, give back.
            
            In a world that’s rapidly evolving with technology, being left behind isn’t an option I want to consider. I decided to push forward, to break past the limitations I face, and to fully immerse myself in the learning journey AltSchool provides.</p>
